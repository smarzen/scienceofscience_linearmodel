An implementation of fitting equations in Dan Baciu's paper on models of arts and humanities to data scraped by Jan Michael Austria, my husband, from OpenAlex: https://openalex.org. To find the number of papers in physics in a year, keyword "physics" and search within that year was implemented. Some of what you see in the pdf is just pedagogical! And some of it is a new fitting procedure, similar to what is used with SINDy, that can be applied to perhaps better data with perhaps some regularization on the weights.
